This app aims to create a musical calendar, an Android application that allows users to explore, track, and manage the performances they intend to see or have already attended. The app offers two primary experiences: first, an intuitive calendar-based interface that allows users to view currently running Broadway or Off-Broadway musicals in New York City using external APIs; and second, a customizable personal calendar that enables users to manually add performances from any city or country they plan to attend. Besides, there will be another UI page that allows users to write reports and upload images for the performance theyâ€™ve attended. By combining real-time event discovery with user-created entries, our app acts as a tool for musical lovers to record their experiences associated with those theatre shows.
